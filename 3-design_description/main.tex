Section \ref{sec:operations} thoroughly documents all of the operations that
AiryScript offers, using the syntax provided in Section \ref{sec:syntax_spec}
and Section \ref{sec:operations_spec}.

\subsection{Devising a language syntax}
\label{sec:devising_syntax}
This section documents how the development process of the syntax of AiryScript.

AiryScript is roughly the third fairly complete language we came up with during
development, and contains elements of both the first and the second language. In
the following subsections, we discuss these ‘iterations’ chronologically.

\subsubsection{Iteration one}
In a first serious attempt at defining AiryScript we tried to approximate
natural language as closely as possible.

The following commands are examples of expressions in this language.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=empty,frame=single]
ADD CITY Brussels, Edinburgh
ADD AIRPORT Brussels TO Brussels, Edinburgh TO Edinburgh
ADD COMPANY SAB
ADD SEATTYPE Economy, Business, First class
ADD AIRPLANE Boeing 007 WITH 100 Economy SEATS, 20 Business SEATS
ADD TIME Brussels TO Edinburgh 1h22 BY Boeing 007
ADD TEMPLATE SAB888 FROM Brussels TO Edinburgh BY Boeing 007
    WITH 21 euro FOR Economy SEATS, 34 euro FOR Business SEATS
        FROM 15/12/2012 TO 9/01/2014
    WITH 168 euro FOR Economy SEATS, 370 euro FOR Business SEATS
        FROM 15/06/2015 TO 9/12/2016, EACH 2nd FRIDAY OF THE MONTH
\end{lstlisting}

We decided to get rid of this language because of the following reasons.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The ‘natural language’ in our DSL is really quite different from real
    natural language. We decided that it is not possible to make complicated
    commands like adding a template look like natural language, because no
    person would try to specify all there is to know about a template in a
    single sentence.
  \item Natural language is different for different persons. The code above
    is easy to understand, but when trying to document or write a statement in
    it it quickly becomes clear that this language, like natural language, is
    fairly irregular and inconsistent.
  \item Irregular languages are difficult to learn.
  \item Writing a parser for this language is difficult, both because it is
    irregular and because of the syntax itself. We prefer not to have any need
    for semicolons or impose indentation rules on our users, which is pretty
    much impossible using this syntax, which uses no commas, parenthesis or
    quotation marks to separate values from language keywords.
\end{itemize}
Some of the things we learned in this process are the following.
\begin{itemize}
  \item When designing a language, one has to focus on the more complicated
    statements that language should be capable of expressing.

    Most of the languages one can come up with look nice when expressing the
    creation of a city, but almost none of them are capable of describing
    templates without turning ugly.
  \item It is a bad idea to
  try and make the language look like natural language.
  \item It is probably a good idea to keep in mind that the DSL needs to be
    machine-readable.
  \item Some things are just way more complicated than people ever care to think
    about. Statements like ‘a flight flies every year at 12h during every second
    Friday of the months August and November’ are very powerful and difficult to
    express in a consistent manner, store and search. Implementing an efficient
    system that is capable of handling periods like this are not in the scope of
    this assignment.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Iteration two}
In a second attempt at defining the AiryScript syntax we came up with a very
general, powerful and compact syntax that is most certainly targeted towards
users with other backgrounds than the language of iteration one.

The following commands are examples of expressions in this language. They have
the same effect as the code in iteration one, except from the fact that we got
rid of the ‘second Friday of the month’-statement.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=empty,frame=single]
AIRPORT { name: Edinburg, city: { name : Edinburg } }
AIRPORT { name: Zaventem, city: { name : Brussels } }
TEMPLATE {
  fln: SAB888
  from: (name: Brussels)
  to: (name: Edinburgh)
  type: { name: "Boeing 007" }
  periods: [
    { from: 15/12/2012, to: 9/01/2014, prices: [
        {type: {name: economy}, price: {euro: 21}},
        {type: {name: business}, price: {euro: 34}}
    ]},{ from: 15/06/2015, to: 9/12/2016, prices: [
        {type: (name: economy), price: {euro: 268}},
        {type: (name: business), price: {euro: 370}}
    ]}
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}
We envisioned this to be a strongly, statically typed language that did not
require the user to ever really specify any types. Curly brackets create a new
structure that would automatically be added to the database, whereas parenthesis
select a structure that already exists. We also developed a syntax to modify
existing structures.

We decided to get rid of this language because of the following reasons.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Complicated statements can become quite difficult to read, especially
    for people who are not familiar with the types behind the language.
  \item Although a language shouldn’t be based on natural language like in
    iteration one, it is always good to be able to read out loud what a series
    of statements does. We cannot do that in this language.
  \item This language is heavily inspired by the structure of our problem
    domain, and forces its users to also be aware of this structure.
  \item The syntax of this language is very general. Without changing too much,
    it could replace SQL for most queries, not just for our database structure
    but for any database structure. This is not a good sign: GlobAir Inc.  is
    dissatisfied with SQL, and wants us to create a \emph{different}
    language.
  \item Because queries can be nested indefinitely and statements have to have
    access to information that is available on a higher level\footnote{For
      example, to define a period we have need of a template to bind it to. In
      the example, we do not specify the FLN of the periods we create, which
      automatically assigns the FLN of the template we are creating on a higher
      level to it.},
    implementing this language would be very hard.
\end{itemize}
Some of the things we learned in this process are the following.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Consistency is important, but so is readability. The language in
    iteration one focussed too much on readability, the language in iteration
    two focussed too much on consistency.
  \item We should try to forget about the database and problem domain structure,
    and try to look trough the eyes of the user of our DSL.
  \item We are dealing with a DSL; we should not be shy about introducing
    language features and syntax that is only relevant for the specific problem
    domain of AiryScript.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Iteration three}
The syntax of the third iteration is the final syntax of AiryScript. The next
sections therefore discuss this syntax into full detail. This section provides a
sneak-peak of what the syntax of AiryScript looks like.

The following commands have the same effect as the code shown for iteration two.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=airyscript,frame=single]
  ADD CITY {name : Brussels}
  ADD CITY {name : Edinburgh}
  ADD AIRLINE {fln: Sab, name: Sabena}
  ADD SEAT TYPE {economy}
  ADD SEAT TYPE {business}
  ADD SEAT TYPE {"first class"}
  ADD AIRPLANE TYPE {
      name: "Boeing 007"
  } WITH SEATS [
      {type: economy, amt: 100},
      {type: business, amt: 20}
  ]
  ADD TEMPLATE {
      fln: SAB888,
      from: {name: Brussels},
      to: {name: Edinburh},
      airplaneType: {name: "Boeing 007"},
  } WITH SEAT INSTANCES [
      {type: economy, price: {dollar: 21}},
      {type: business, price: {dollar: 34}}
  ] AND WITH PERIODS [
      {
          from: {d: 25, m: 12, y: 2012},
          to: {d: 9, m: 1, y: 2014},
          departure: {h :12}
      },{
          from: {d: 15, m:  6, y: 2012},
          to: {d: 9, m: 12, y: 2016},
          departure: {h: 15, m:35}
      }
  ]
  CHANGE SEAT INSTANCES OF FLIGHT {
      template: {fln: SAB888},
      during: {
          from: { d: 15, m:  6, y: 2012 },
          to: { d: 9, m: 12, y: 2016 },
      }
  } TO [
    {type: business, price: {dollar: 268}},
    {type: economy, price: {dollar: 370}}
  ]
\end{lstlisting}
We believe this language is a healthy mix between elements from the languages in
iteration one and two.
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is possible to read sentences out loud, just like in the language of
    iteration one. The labels and commands in front of structures make them
    quite readable.

    We believe that even without ever having seen a description of what the
    different operations in our language do or having seen a
    description of the syntax of our language, people familiar with the domain
    of Section \ref{sec:domain} are capable of understanding what the code above
    does.
  \item The language is consistent, just like in iteration two. When provided
    with the manual, users should quickly be able to start writing queries.
  \item The language is quite robust. Lots of invalid queries produce parsing
    errors.
  \item Unlike the languages in iteration one and two, this language can be
    implemented!
\end{itemize}
Note that this is actually a very bad example to show off the new syntax.  The
old syntaxes still assumed a domain model where prices are linked to time
periods. This new syntax uses the domain model that Section \ref{sec:domain}
describes, and links prices to a template. We can still achieve the same pricing
configuration by changing the prices of the flights over a specified time
period, but this requires an additional operation.


\subsection{Protecting the user}
\label{sec:protecting}
Before we continue with the technical details of the meta model of our DSL
that we choose after the last iteration we take a small sidestep.

This section explains our decision to prefer more powerful operations over more
safe ones. We use the ‘change city’ operation as a simple example where the
difference between powerful and safe is clearly visible.

At some point in the design of the DSL, we have to decide on specific types and
operations. For changing distances, we can come up with two possibilities that
make perfect sense.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.5\textwidth}p{0.5\textwidth}}
  Approach one & Approach two \\\hline
  \begin{lstlisting}
Dist = {
    ?from:Airport,
    ?to: Airport,
    ?dist:Int
}
Dist_data = {
    from:Airport,
    to: Airport,
    dist:Int
}

CHANGE DISTANCE <Dist> TO <Dist>
  \end{lstlisting} &
  \begin{lstlisting}
Dist = {
    from:Airport,
    to: Airport
}
Dist_data = {
    from:Airport,
    to: Airport,
    dist:Int
}


CHANGE DISTANCE <Dist> TO <Int>
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The language syntax is expressive enough to be able to handle both approaches,
but naturally we have to decide on only one.

\paragraph{Approach one}
defines a very general change operator that not only allows
changing the distance of a single pair of airport, but also the \tye{from} and
\tye{to} properties of existing pairs of airports or even groups of pairs of
airports.

The main advantage of this approach lies it its consistency.  We can use very
similar operation definitions for changes to other types of data, for example
\begin{quote}
  \tye{CHANGE FLIGHTTIME <FlightTime> TO <FlightTime>}
\end{quote}
and
\begin{quote}
  \tye{CHANGE TEMPLATE <Template> TO <Template>}
  ,
\end{quote}
which really means that we have a generic change operations.

This is just a single example, but taking into consideration all types we can
distinguish the following advantages and disadvantages.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The advantage of this approach is that we have fairly few, simple
    operations that are easy for users to learn. There is also the possibility
    to execute very powerful queries.
  \item The disadvantage of this approach is that it allows users to write
    queries that are \emph{too} general. It allows users to execute
    operations that do not make sense.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Approach two}
defines a more restricted change distance operator that only allows changing
single, existing distances between pairs of cities.

Approach one allows users to execute queries like
\begin{quote}
  \tye{CHANGE DISTANCE {from: {name: Zaventem}} TO {dist: 1000}}
\end{quote}
or even
\begin{quote}
  \tye{CHANGE DISTANCE {dist: 5000} TO {dist: 1000}}
  .
\end{quote}
The first query changes the distance of all flights that start from the Zaventem
airport to 1000km, which of course only make sense as long as there is only one
such distance in the database. The second query changes the distance between all
pairs of cities with a distance of 5000km to a distance of 1000km. The main
advantage of the second approach is therefore increased safety.

These are just examples, but taking into consideration all types we can
distinguish the following advantages and disadvantages.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The advantage of this approach is increased safety for the users, as
    they are no longer capable of destroying the contents of the database with a
    single query.
  \item The disadvantage of this approach is increased language complexity
    for manipulating more complicated domain elements. We potentially
    have to create a lot of different selection types and operations for the
    different things we want to be able to change about these elements.

    Also, queries become less powerful. It is probably impossible to restrict
    users so much that he cannot do anything wrong without imposing some
    restrictions that are usually just irritating. For example, approach one
    does not allow a user to rectify his or her mistake after entering a distance
    between York Airport and Zaventem instead of New York and Zaventem: he has
    to delete the mistake and add a new distance again. As another example,
    allowing the user to specify prices for only a single flight at a time makes
    the ‘change prices’ operation safer, but also less powerful.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Our train of thought}
While in the case of airports it is fairly easy to protect users from themselves
by not allowing them to execute non-sensible queries, this is not the case for
more complicated domain elements like flights or flight templates. We feel that
if take approach two here, then this means that we take it upon ourselves to
protect users from themselves like this for all types and operations, also the
more complicated ones.

Because we saw that the number of types and operations that are necessary to
prevent users from executing potentially disastrous queries on the database
(approach two) is much greater than the number of types and operations necessary
for approach one, we decided to take approach one for AiryScript. We think that
this is usually something you have discuss with the client of the DSL. Which
approach is best also heavily depends on the background of the users of
AiryScript.

\paragraph{AiryScript is still safer than SQL}
While we give users access to powerful operations and do not protect them from
filling up the database with nonsense, AiryScript certainly does aim to make it
impossible for users to make data \emph{inconsistent}. This is the only
requirement specified in the assignment. For example, it is impossible to create
a template where an airplane type $t$ flies from city $a$ to city $b$ if there
is no flight time available for the combination of $a$, $b$ and $t$. It is also
impossible to delete a flight time for $a$, $b$, $t$ as long as there still
exists a template that relies on it. Basically, AiryScript makes sure all the
constraints specified in the domain of Section \ref{sec:domain} are kept.




\subsection{The semantic model}


% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Meta-Model.jpg}
% \caption{High level semantic model.}
% \label{fig:semantic-model}
% \end{figure}

Lets look at how the final structure of our language looks like after the
third iteration. This is represented schematically in \ref{fig:semantic-model}.
This is the high level semantic model of our DSL, we did not include all the
individual operations and structure types in the diagram but they all satisfy
the given model.

The semantic model is basically the point of contact between the parser and
the handler (the part of the system executing those operations, which involves
querying the database). The parser will populate this model, while the handler
will act upon this model, which is a nice way of decoupling these 2
functionalities.

Concretely all the operations and structures in this semantic model map 1 to 1
with scala case classes. The parser will parse a string into the proper
\class{Operation}-case class. This piece of data can be passed to the handler to
actually perform the operation.

But we are running ahead, lets first examine these operations, structures and
primitive types in more detail.


\subsection{Describing and creating structures}
\label{sec:syntax_spec}
This section specifies how to create structures in AiryScript and explains the
notation that Section \ref{sec:operations} uses to specify types. Even though
AiryScript does not require its users to declare types or provide them with
the possibility to define their own types, knowing how to describe types and how
the typing system of AiryScript works is important, since AiryScript is a typed
language.

\paragraph{Primitive types}
AiryScript supports strings and integers as primitive types. The statements
\begin{quote}
  \tye{5}\\
  \tye{502349}
\end{quote}
define the integers 5 and 502349. The statements
\begin{quote}
  \tye{IAmFreeOfSpacesAndIThereforeDoNotRequireQuotation}\\
  \tye{"I am not free of spaces and therefore I do require quotation"}\\
  \tye{"IAmFreeOfSpacesYetICanStillUseQuotation"}
\end{quote}
each define a string. Users should surround strings that contain spaces and/or
commas with quotation marks.


\paragraph{Structures}
AiryScript also supports structures. Structures consist of one or several
properties. Properties have a name and a value. A name is always a string that
does not contain any spaces. A value is either a primitive value or another
structure. Names are separated from values by a colon, properties are separated
from each other by commas and structures are defined within curly brackets. As
an example,
\begin{quote}
  \ins{a: 10, b: 5}
\end{quote}
defines a structure with a property named \tye{a} that has an integer primitive
value of ten and a property named \tye{b} that has an integer primitive value of
five. AiryScript is not sensitive to whitespace or newlines. For example,
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
{  a:10, b       :
                    5}
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
defines the same structure as before.


\paragraph{Basic structure types}
In the documentation,
\begin{quote}
  \ty{A}\tye{ = \ins{a: Int, b: String}}
\end{quote}
defines \ty{A} to be shorthand for the type that collects all structures that
have properties named \tye{a} and \tye{b} with respective types \tye{Int} and
\tye{String}. Structures that define an \tye{Int} and a \tye{String} with
different names do not belong to type \ty{A}. This simple definition completely
describes a type. If AiryScript would allow users to define their own types and
operations, this would be the syntax it would use.

As an example, the following two lines each define a structure that is an
instance of \ty{A}.
\begin{quote}
  \ins{a: 10, b: tomatoes}\\
  \ins{b: "bottles of beer", a: 10}\\
\end{quote}


\paragraph{Types with optional properties}
In the documentation,
\begin{quote}
  \ty{B}\tye{ = \ins{a: Int, ?b: Int, ?c: String}}
\end{quote}
defines \ty{B} to be shorthand to the type that collects all structures that
have properties named \tye{a} with type \ty{Int}, and that optionally has two
more properties with names \tye{b} and \tye{c} and values with respective types
\ty{Int} and \ty{String}. Structures that either have parameters
with names different from \tye{a}, \tye{b} or \tye{c} or that have an \tye{a},
\tye{b} or \tye{c} with a different type do not belong to \ty{B}.

As an example, all of the following lines define a structure that is an
instance of \ty{B}.
\begin{quote}
  \ins{c: "bottles of beer", a: 10}\\
  \ins{a: 10, b: 5 c: "bottles of beer"}\\
  \ins{a: 10, b: 5}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Types of nested structures}
In the documentation,
\begin{quote}
  \ty{C}\tye{ = \ins{a: B, b: String}}
\end{quote}
defines \ty{C} to be shorthand for the type of structures that have properties
with names \tye{aB} and \tye{aString}, with types \tye{B} and \tye{String}
respectively. Since we can further expand \ty{B}, this is in turn shorthand for
\begin{quote}
  \ins{a: \ins{a: Int, ?b: Int, ?c: String}, b: String}.
\end{quote}

As an example, the following line defines a structure that is an instance of
\ty{C}.
\begin{quote}
  \ins{b: \ins{a: 10, b: 5}, a: "bottles of beer"}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Union types}
In the documentation,
\begin{quote}
  \ty{D}\tye{ = A | B}
\end{quote}
defines a type that contains both the structures contained in \tye{A} and the
structures contained in \tye{B}.

As an example, both of the following lines define a structure that is an
instance of \ty{D}.
\begin{quote}
  \ins{a: 10, b: tomatoes}\\
  \ins{a: 10, b: 5}
\end{quote}


\paragraph{Lists}
In the documentation,
\begin{quote}
  \ty{E}\tye{ = [Int]}
\end{quote}
defines a type that contains a list of integers. List elements are separated
by commas and defined within square brackets. Naturally, lists can also occur
within structures. The ordering of elements in a list is preserved during
interpretation; whether or not the ordering matters depends on the operation the
list is passed to.

As an example, the following two lines each define an instance of \ty{E}.
\begin{quote}
  \tye{[1,2,3,4]}\\
  \tye{[   5 , 2,1,2]}
\end{quote}


\subsection{Type system}
\label{sec:structural_type_system}
This section describes the type system of AiryScript. Section
\ref{sec:type_classification} classifies the type system into some categories
that are well-known in computer science. Section \ref{sec:type_example} provides
some examples to illustrate how the type system works.

\subsubsection{Classification}
\label{sec:type_classification}
The type system of AiryScript is.
\begin{description}
  \item[Strongly typed] When AiryScript expects a parameter of type $T$, it is
    not possible to provide it with another type. It is not possible to cast
    values to another type, and there is no type that matches all types.
  \item[Statically typed] AiryScript determines and checks types while parsing.
  \item[Structural] Type compatibility and equivalence are determined by the
    type’s actual structure or definition. Subtyping relations cannot be
    declared explicitly but are created automatically by shared structure.
  \item[Implicit] AiryScript never requires the user to explicitly declare any
    types.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Examples}
\label{sec:type_examples}
This section discusses the structural type system of AiryScript by providing an
extended example.

We look at the type of object $o$ defined as
\begin{quote}
  \ins{a: 10, c: "bottles of beer"}.
\end{quote}
The type of $o$ is \ins{a: Int, c: String}. A discussion of the relation between
the type of $o$ and the following types should clarify how the type system of
AiryScript works.
\begin{quote}
  \ty{A}\tye{ = \ins{c: String, a: Int}}\\
  \ty{B}\tye{ = \ins{a: Int, ?b: Int, ?c: String}}\\
  \ty{C}\tye{ = \ins{a: Int, b: String, c: String}}\\
  \ty{D}\tye{ = \ins{c: Int, a: String}}
\end{quote}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $o$ is an instance of \ty{A}. In fact, \ty{A} is just shorthand for
    $o$’s type. The order in which \tye{c} and \tye{a} appear does not matter:
    as far as AiryScript is concerned the types \ins{c: String, a:Int}
    and \ins{a:Int, c: String} are identical. The one-dimensional nature of text
    makes it so that we have to specify an ordering that is actually
    meaningless.

  \item $o$ is an instance of \ty{B}, which also means that \ty{A} is a subtype
    of \ty{B}.  We can ‘ignore’ the optional properties of \tye{c}. Note that
    the fact that \ty{C} can be a super type of \ty{B} without having to specify
    this in \ty{C} is quite special, and typical for structural type systems.

  \item $o$ is not an instance of \ty{C}. \ty{A} and \ty{C} are not related.

    While in most existing structural type systems, like the one of Haxe, \ty{C}
    would be a subtype of \ty{B}, this is not the case in AiryScript. This is
    because AiryScript does not allow users to specify properties that are not
    defined by the type. \ins{a: "bla"} is not an instance of type \ins{a:
    String, b: String} in AiryScript. The only way to to create a typing
    hierarchy is through optional parameters.

  \item $o$ is not an instance of \ty{D}. \ty{A} and \ty{D} are not related.

    Even though \ty{D} also consists of two properties, one an \tye{Int} and one
    a \tye{String}, \ty{D} is unrelated to \ty{A} because the names of these
    properties are different in \ty{D} and \ty{A}. The names of properties are
    part of the type, which allows AiryScript to make types independent of the
    order of their properties.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Describing and calling operations}
\label{sec:operations_spec}
This section specifies how to perform operations in AiryScript and explains the
notation that Section \ref{sec:operations} uses to specify operations.


\paragraph{Basic operations}
In the documentation,
\begin{quote}
  \tye{DO INTEGER <Int>}
\end{quote}
specifies an operation that takes an integer. Together with the operation
signature, the documentation defines what an operation does. Users can call the
function above in an AiryScript script file as
\begin{quote}
  \tye{DO INTEGER 5}
  .
\end{quote}
It is also possible to write
\begin{quote}
  \tye{DO INTEGER \{5\}}
  ;
\end{quote}
we leave it up to the user to decide which syntax he/she likes best.
Of course, operations can also take structures as their arguments. Users can
separate all parts by one or multiple spaces and/or newlines. For example,
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
DO          INTEGER
      5 DO INTEGER 10
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
does what the user wants and performs the operation \tye{DO INTEGER} twice.
Note that AiryScript does not require the user to put a semicolon at the end of
an operation or between operations.
AiryScript does not parse input like
\begin{quote}
  \tye{ADDINTEGERS 5 10} .
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Separated operations}
Some operations in AiryScript take multiple arguments. Although AiryScript is
capable of parsing input like
\begin{quote}
  \tye{DO STUFF TO DURING <Stuff> <Something> <Period>}
  ,
\end{quote}
we believe this is not very legible. AiryScript’s operations are therefore
usually split up like
\begin{quote}
  \tye{DO <Stuff> TO <Something> DURING <Period>}
\end{quote}
to increase legibility. Note that this really does define a \emph{single
operation} that has access to three arguments (instances of \tye{Stuff},
\tye{Something} and \tye{Period}) and not three operations (\tye{DO}, \tye{TO}
and \tye{DURING}) that each operate on a single argument.

The order of the keywords is fixed, so users are not able to write
\begin{quote}
  \tye{DO \{…\} DURING \{…\} TO \{…\}}
  .
\end{quote}

AiryScript allows users to put spaces and newlines in between keywords, but we
advise users to write legible code by keeping these kind of ‘separated
operations’ together, and not separate them by newlines.


%Operations in AiryScript are always capitalized.




%\subsection{Though decisions}
%\label{sec:though_decisions}
%This section documents some of the tougher choices we had to make when designing
%specific operations for the language.
%
%This section often refers to actual operations in the language, but is not a
%language description. See Section \ref{sec:operations} for a consistent and
%complete overview of all operations and types.
%
%As is often the case with though choices, each possible decision has advantages
%and disadvantages. We made choices only after several hours of discussion.
