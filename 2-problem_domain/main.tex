\section{Problem Domain}
This section describes the problem domain underlying AiryScript. The first
subsection lists domain elements already present in the original commissioning
made by GlobAir Inc.. The second subsection continues by filling in the blanks
that were left in there. Together, the first and second subsections provide a
complete description of the problem domain. The third subsection analyses the
problem domain, trying to distinguish core concepts from details and connecting
the concepts. It thereby acts as an important basis for the design of
AiryScript.

\subsection{Original commissioning}
This subsection documents the domain elements present in the original
commissioning made by GlobAir Inc..


\subsection{Filling in the blanks}
This subsection documents problem domain elements that are not in the original
commissioning made by GlobAir Inc.. Most of these decisions were made in
consultation with GlobAirâ€™s domain expert Dave Clarke.

\subsection{Domain analysis}
This subsection analyses the domain elements introduced by the previous two
subsections. It acts as a basis for decisions on the syntax of AiryScript.
