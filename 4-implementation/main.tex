\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Implementation overview}

We divided the implementation in 3 parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The parser: Responsible for parsing a string into the right operation, or
returning a parse error if the given expression was incorrect.
\item The operation handler: The actual implementation of all the different
operators. This part is responsible for verifying all the arguments of an
operation and either trowing an error if these arguments were
incorrect/incomplete or performing the operation. Both for verifying aswell as
performing an operation database acces is required.
\item The database: We used an SQL database to backup the system. The
implementation of this database closely resembles the domain model.
\end{enumerate}

All of the operations and types are resembled by a single case class in scala,
which captures all of the required information to use this. The parser will
parse a string into an operation, after which this is passed to the second
phase. The handler can then handle these operations by pattern matching over the
different kinds of operators and their respective arguments.
